# Welcome to our brief website tour. As a doctor, you can create a new account if you don't have one already. Once registered, you'll have the ability to seamlessly manage your patient data. This includes adding new patients, deleting patient records, editing existing patient information, and viewing patient details.

Furthermore, you can update your profile data at any time. Rest assured that all your data is securely saved, and when you're done, you can log out for added security.
